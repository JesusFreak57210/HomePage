<!-- I think this class went really well, I enjoyed taking the knowledge I gained in the first part of the class and putting it to a more practical use, it was also cool to recognize the patterns between the different programming languages that I have studied. I think if I were to change or suggest anything about the class it would be a little more hands on learning. That is not my learning style per se but I know that some people are kinestetic and it might be helpful. -->
